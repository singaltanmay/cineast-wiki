Cineast can be interfaced with using its [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) REST API.

To view the REST API documentation, navigate to `cineast-url:port/swagger-ui` where `cineast-url` is the URL of a running Cineast instance and `port` is the port the REST API is configured to use (4567 by default).
The OpenAPI specifications used to automatically generate client code for the REST API can be accessed similarly at `cineast-url:port/openapi-specs`.
