# Working with IIIF
Cineast supports performing extraction on IIIF resources hosted on compatible media servers. During the feature extraction process, Cineast will automatically download all the resources specified in the extraction config file to a folder on the local filesystem and perform extraction on it.

## Image API
Cineast can donwload indivual image resources in any region, size, rotation, format and quality; provided that these parameters are supported by the server.

Image API versions supported by Cineast:
- 2.1.1
- 3.0

### Configuring an Image API Extraction job

An Image API job can be configured in the `iiif` object block in the `iiif_extraction_config.json` configuration file. Here is an extract from the example configuration file.

```
"imageApiUrl": "https://example.com",
"imageApiVersion": "2.1.1",
"rotation": 10,
"items": [
    {
        "identifier": "image1",
        "region": "square"
    },
    {
        "identifier": "image2",
        "rotation": 180,
        "quality": "bitonal",
        "format": "png"
    }
]
```

The Image API URL's generated by Cineast based on this config are:
- https://example.com/image1/square/full/10/default.jpg
- https://example.com/image2/full/full/180/bitonal.png

If the `ImageApiVersion` is not specified then Cineast will try automatically try to determine the highest version of the API supported by the server.
