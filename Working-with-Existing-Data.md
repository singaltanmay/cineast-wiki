# Setup guide for working with existing data
This page is mostly intended for students working with data from the Video Browser Showdown (VBS) or the Lifelog Search Challenge (LSC).

## Cottontail Setup
For Cottontail, we provide folders which contain extracted features and metadata. Be aware that Cottontail 0.12.0 changed storage format, for competitions where two versions of the data exist, you'll find appropriate tags.

Simply unzip the provided zip and make sure your cottontail config points to the correct folder.

## Cineast Setup
We should provide Cineast config files in the same download-path as the datasets. It is possible that config formats have changed. If that happens, please make the corresponding changes and alert your supervisor so they can fix the file.

## Frontend Setup

For most datasets, we should have the media and thumbnails on a node accessible within the VPN. Ask your supervisor for a local copy.
